# Advance Data Structure and Algorithm
This repository is collection of my answer of various questions to activities in my advance data structures and algorithms class. Please noted that not all of the answers are correct. Topics under these activities are Recursions, Divide and Conquer, Graphs ( Breadth-first Search and Depth-first Search ) and Genetic Algorithms. I also added here my final project and created paper in this course.

Here is some output from the project itself :
